So after a lot of research I decided to purchase a speaker kit from GR Research. However, like many industries during Covid impacted by supply chain shortages, the only kit available was for the Desktop \"Mini\". No problem, I'd never used a soldering iron before and it was the cheapest kit in the line up, so it seemed like the perfect choice. Warning The Desktop \"Mini\" is now discontinued and replaced by the Little Giant Killer 2.0 (LGK). The same build process can be used with all of the available speaker kits. Watch a few of GR Research's videos and you'll soon understand the benefits of building your own speakers. There truly is great bang for the buck and the satisfaction of doing it yourself. You'll need some tools to ensure a successful build, but overall the experience and results are worth the expense and effort. Although you can't buy the Desktop \"Mini\", these steps are still applicable for most DIY speaker kits. Recommended Tools 4 Irwin Quick-Grip clamps (or similar) or Dubuque Aluminum Bar Clamps (size will depend on your speaker kit) Router with a 3/4\" round bit Router table (optional) Disposable sponge roller Soldering Iron Heat gun Drill and 1/4\" drill bit Torque and Phillips screwdrivers (size will vary depending on scew sizes) Additional Requirements Wood Glue 220 sand paper 1 sheet of No Rez or insulation DuraTex Plastic Bags (Optional depending on the Duratex finish) 1 can of spray paint (colour of your choice) Zip ties 8 3/4\" wood screws Building the Speakers Assembling the Speaker Boxes Even though these are small speakers, gluing up the boxes can be a challenge. Lay out the speaker box pieces and do a dry run prior to the glue up. Also, determine the position the clamps and set them to fit in preparation. Note I used clamps on all four corners to ensure the sides were sealed tightly. Glue the pieces together in the following order: Apply glue to the bottom dadoes. Apply glue to the left side dadoes, connect it to the back, and then set into the bottom. Apply glue to the right side dadoes, and connect it to the previous assembly. Connect the front. Apply glue to the top dadoes and complete the box assembly. Clamp the speaker and remove any excess glue squeeze out. Repeat for the second speaker. Finishing the Speaker Boxes Sand the joints to ensure they are smooth so that the joint lines are hidden when finished. Rounding the speaker edges is optional but highly recommended. It reduces refraction and makes the speakers more durable to dings and dents. I used a 3/4\" round bit with my router set in a router table. Given the small size of the speakers using a router table makes the task much safer and easier. I rounded the front and side edges with the router. I left the back edges as is and just soften the edges by lightly sanding them. Apply DuraTex with a disposable sponge roller to all sides, excluding the back of the speakers. While the DuraTex is still wet dab it with a balled up plastic bag to provide a nice knockdown textured finish. Apply three coats of spray paint in the desired colour. My son chose this colour, Behr Paint+Primer Flirt Alert (red). Assembling the Crossovers Twist connect the crossover components together so that they fit the crossover board. Mark the location of the four screw holes to mount the crossover board to the speaker and to zip tie the components to the board. Drill the holes in the crossover board. Solder the crossover component connects. Attach the crossover components to the board with zip ties. Solder the speaker wire connections. Use a heat gun to shrink-tube the speaker wire connections on the crossover assembly. Final Assembly Attach the crossover to the bottom of the speakers with 3/4\" wood screws. This step is the trickiest part of the build due to the small size of the speaker opening. An angled electric screw driver can greatly simplify this step. Insulate the speaker cabinet walls. I used insulation I had on hand, but will use No Rez in future builds. Attach, solder, and shrink-tube the binding post and speaker connections. Attach the binding post insert and speakers to the cabinet with the screws provided.","title":"Desktop Mini"},{"location":"Audiophilia/DesktopMini/#desktop-mini-build","text":"GR Research Speakers I've wanted to build a pair of speakers for a very long time and during Covid I was looking for a project to work on.

Ingredients 1 1/2 cups ham, roughly chopped 1/2 tbsp olive oil 3 tbsp butter 1 garlic clove, minced 1 small onion, diced (or half large onion) (yellow, brown or white) 2 potatoes, peeled and diced into small cubes 1 1/2 cups frozen corn (or drained canned corn) 5 tbsp flour 2 cups milk (I use low fat but full fat will work too) 1 cup chicken stock 1 1/2 - 2 cups water 1/2 tsp salt Black pepper Instructions Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes until translucent. Do not let the onion brown. Add the flour and whisk until mixed through the butter. Pour 1 cup of milk in and whisk until it starts to thicken (around 1 1/2 minutes), then pour the remaining cup of milk in. Whisk until it thickens - around 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Then add the chicken stock, and 1 1/2 cups of water and whisk until combined. Increase heat to medium high and add the potatoes into the soup. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, whisking fairly regularly to ensure the soup doesn't stick to the bottom of the saucepan. The soup will thicken as it cooks. Use the remaining 1/2 cup of water if the soup gets too thick before the potato has finished cooking. Just before the potato has finished cooking, add the corn in (just to heat it through). While the potato is cooking, heat olive oil in a small fry pan over high heat. Add the ham and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes until nicely browned. Remove fry pan from the heat and set aside. When the potato is cooked (tender but still holding its shape), remove the soup from the stove and stir through ham (reserve a bit for garnish). If the soup is too thick for your liking, use water (or milk) to get the soup to your desired consistency. Add the salt and 5 grinds of black pepper, then do a taste test and adjust the saltiness if required.

Counter top is fine. Using your hands shape flour into a mound. Using 2 fingers create a well starting in the middle of the mound. Crack 2 eggs into the center of the well. Using a fork scramble eggs while picking up some of the flour from the wall of the well and mix into eggs. After mixing in some of the flour using your hands mix the balance of the flour into the egg/flour mixture. Using your hands form a dough ball if the dough seems dry add water a bit at a time until it all comes together. If the dough seems too wet after adding water add some flour. Knead the dough for 8 minutes. The dough should be smooth on top and bounce back when you gently press your thumb into the surface.

Once a week, we were bused to a local school for woodworking, home economics, or art. My first project was a reasonably simple sculpture that didn't require any exceptional skills. Starting with dimensioned lumber, I used a hand saw to cut the two pieces I needed to size, the main sculpture and a base. The two parts were shaped with a bandsaw, and then I used a rasp and sandpaper to refine the cut edges. A hole was drilled into each piece, then a short dowel was used to connect them. A quick stain and I'd completed my first woodworking project. The inspiration for my sculpture came from the Concorde, which at the time was a relatively new French-British turbojet-powered supersonic airliner, capable of a maximum speed of over twice the speed of sound. The following year I stepped it up a notch, making a pair of bookends that combined my woodworking and art projects. I added basic joinery to my repertoire using butt joints to assemble the bookends. In art class, I drew a running elk and pressed the image onto thin copper plates, which I stained and attached to the bookends with brass brads. These bookends have adorned my bookshelves everywhere I've lived, except Japan, since 1980. I continued woodworking throughout high school. Taking woodworking classes happened somewhat through fate. Every year I tried to take Auto Shop or Electricity; however, I was an Advanced student, so the General level students got priority for shop classes. Inevitably, during the first week of classes, I would be kicked out so General level students could take my spot, leaving woodworking as my only option, which I guess was less popular than the other shop classes. I ended up getting six high school credits for woodworking, which developed the foundation of my skills and started a lifelong passion for a hobby I hope to enjoy in retirement as a more full-time endeavor between rounds of golf. Grade nine brought an introduction to hand tools where we took raw lumber and had to dimension and finish some of the pieces by hand. For most of the other work, we were allowed to use the shop machinery. Oddly, for this project and the cabinet I built in grade eleven, I used willow. I liked the colour and grain, but most of all I chose it because it was the cheapest wood available for purchase in our woodworking class. In all my trips to lumber yards since I've never encountered willow as an option to purchase, nor have I come across an article in a woodworking magazine or book that mentions willow as a wood choice for building furniture. Maybe willow's availability was due to being in the Niagara Region, which had a lot of willows lining the shores of the rivers in the area. In the grade ten woodworking class, we built a toolbox, which introduced hinged joints and was my first project using plywood. It sat empty for twenty-five years until we moved into our first house and I started buying tools for home renovations. Grade eleven involved a much larger project. I built a cabinet from plans I found in a magazine. I was quite satisfied with the build; however, I was in a rush at the end of the project and selected a poor finish. I've always intended to strip and redo the cabinet finish but never got around to it. For the top, I selected the best figured wood. However, once finished and ready for assembly, I agonized over which side to use. The original pristine side turned out exactly as I wanted, and the opposite side intended to face inward was flawed with rot hollows. In the end, I chose the flawed side because I thought it added character to the piece. Overall the rot details enhanced the intended rustic appearance of the cabinet and added an immediate sense of age. Going with the alternate side was a decision I've never regretted and continue to make similar choices on projects in the constant battle between my perfectionist nature and artistic instinct. The grade twelve woodworking class project was a step stool. The challenge was working out joinery that involved joints intersecting at compound angles. The stool still resides in my shop and is as structurally stable as the day I built it, although now it has a more distressed look from use. High school woodworking classes provided the foundation for my furniture making and construction knowledge, skills that have served me well throughout my life. On the commute into work this morning, I heard on the radio that most millennials have never used basic tools such as a screwdriver or hammer and rely on their fathers for assistance. Trades and hand tool skills appear to be in decline, but I've moved in the opposite direction, preferring to do renovations and build furniture myself. I rarely see a piece of store-bought furniture that I'd purchase by choice and prefer to find a quality antique or make it myself. The savings gained doing the renovations myself leaves extra budget for high-end finishing and more flexibility for customization. Also, I struggle with paying someone for subpar work and only bring in help if a job requires specialized skills or equipment, or to save time. Home renovations began with our first house, purchased in 1997 in Acton, ON. At first, I think my wife was skeptical of my capabilities and some of the projects I pursued, but over time and after seeing the results, she came to trust that I would get the job done. The only concession was that it often took a long time, and as a result, our houses were always in some form of half-completed renovation and rarely in a state of completion to satisfy her requirements to host parties. Following high school, my woodworking took an extended hiatus (1987-2001). I spent several years in university and college, lived in Japan for a year, began my career, got married, and started a family. During that period, I kept an eye out for furniture I liked and kept a mental list of furniture projects I wanted to tackle in the future. The chance to do a quick furniture build, a computer cabinet, came shortly after moving into our second house. Time was short, my son Ben was a newborn, and the tools I had on hand were limited. I knew exactly the type of cabinet I wanted to build, and I ran out to Home Depot one Saturday morning and purchased 2' x 4' pine boards. Armed with a skill saw, router, and drill, I went to work and completed the cabinet in under an hour. The cabinet fit the space in my office and served its purpose for the time we spent in that house. Being in IT, I built my computers and was constantly upgrading the system or needing access to the connections on the back of the computer. To simplify access, I designed the right side of the cabinet as removable to provide easy access to the connection ports or to remove the whole computer case. Now it serves as a computer stand for a set up I use primarily for listening to music. Building that computer cabinet reignited my drive to get back into woodworking, but it would be several more years before I was able to start. Home renovations took precedence - we moved into our third house (Richmond Hill) and then a fourth (Newmarket). During that period, I spent a lot of time perusing the Lee Valley website planning for the day I could finally pull the trigger to stock my woodworking shop with tools. It was shortly after moving into our fourth house in 2012 that I could dedicate a room for a workshop, had a small amount of free time, and was in a financial position to start buying tools. However, the main incentive to get back into woodworking was building a hall table for my wife's birthday present. It's now early spring 2023, and I'm regularly in the workshop. There has been a steady progression of projects, workshop improvements, jig-making, and tool purchases since 2012 that have led me to begin writing this journal. I find myself wanting to spend more and more time woodworking for many reasons. I look forward to heading down into the workshop in the evenings after work. Woodworking provides a great mental break to clear my mind of the constant problem resolution and stress that comes with my career as a Cyber Security Specialist. I don't even have to be working on a project. Just going down into the shop to clean up, sweep the floor or sharpen a chisel or plane blade helps to ease my mind. An added benefit of just doing chores is that when I dive into a project, the shop and tools are ready to start working. My mind immediately switches gears after stepping into the shop and taking in the fragrance of the wood. Besides stress, the other detriment to my health after spending a quarter of a century in Cyber Security is that I have developed tendonitis. The occasional flare-ups cause my hands to swell up and become extremely painful, stiff, useless clumps at the end of my arms. Using my hands for woodworking provides a great form of physical therapy that counters the impact of typing on a keyboard and using a mouse all day for work. I thoroughly enjoy the time I spend woodworking and have a long list of projects lined up for the future. I probably won't get through all of the projects given I'm now in my mid fifties with retirement still a few years away. One reason for writing this journal is to keep track of the lessons I learn, to capture the knowledge I gain with each project, and who knows, maybe it will become a helpful reference for someone once completed. It is abundantly clear to me through my research and efforts so far that woodworking is a hobby requiring continuous practice and a lifetime to achieve a high level of mastery. My intention for writing this journal is to document the thought processes and techniques used to build furniture I've designed to outlast me and to pass down from one generation to the next. I have lofty ambitions of making furniture that encompasses the lessons and techniques learned by past master furniture makers with timeless appeal and the construction to survive the rigors of everyday use. And who know, the details referenced in this journal may allow someone many decades or hundreds of years from now to perform the inevitable repairs needed to keep the furniture functional or maintain its appearance. I expect this journal will undoubtedly provide value for me, at least as a record of what I've accomplished and who knows maybe as a guide for others as well. It's all about the journey ahead.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Woodworking/001_ww_intro/#introduction","text":"My introduction to woodworking began back in 1979 in grade seven.

The chance to do a quick furniture build, a computer cabinet, came shortly after moving into our second house. Time was short, my son Ben was a newborn, and the tools I had on hand were limited. I knew exactly the type of cabinet I wanted to build, and I ran out to Home Depot one Saturday morning and purchased 2' x 4' pine boards. Armed with a skill saw, router, and drill, I went to work and completed the cabinet in under an hour. The cabinet fit the space in my office and served its purpose for the time we spent in that house. Being in IT, I built my computers and was constantly upgrading the system or needing access to the connections on the back of the computer. To simplify access, I designed the right side of the cabinet as removable to provide easy access to the connection ports or to remove the whole computer case. Now it serves as a computer stand for a set up I use primarily for listening to music. Building that computer cabinet reignited my drive to get back into woodworking, but it would be several more years before I was able to start. Home renovations took precedence - we moved into our third house (Richmond Hill) and then a fourth (Newmarket). During that period, I spent a lot of time perusing the Lee Valley website planning for the day I could finally pull the trigger to stock my woodworking shop with tools. It was shortly after moving into our fourth house in 2012 that I could dedicate a room for a workshop, had a small amount of free time, and was in a financial position to start buying tools. However, the main incentive to get back into woodworking was building a hall table for my wife's birthday present. It's now early spring 2023, and I'm regularly in the workshop. There has been a steady progression of projects, workshop improvements, jig-making, and tool purchases since 2012 that have led me to begin writing this journal. I find myself wanting to spend more and more time woodworking for many reasons. I look forward to heading down into the workshop in the evenings after work. Woodworking provides a great mental break to clear my mind of the constant problem resolution and stress that comes with my career as a Cyber Security Specialist. I don't even have to be working on a project. Just going down into the shop to clean up, sweep the floor or sharpen a chisel or plane blade helps to ease my mind. An added benefit of just doing chores is that when I dive into a project, the shop and tools are ready to start working. My mind immediately switches gears after stepping into the shop and taking in the fragrance of the wood. Besides stress, the other detriment to my health after spending a quarter of a century in Cyber Security is that I have developed tendonitis. The occasional flare-ups cause my hands to swell up and become extremely painful, stiff, useless clumps at the end of my arms. Using my hands for woodworking provides a great form of physical therapy that counters the impact of typing on a keyboard and using a mouse all day for work. I thoroughly enjoy the time I spend woodworking and have a long list of projects lined up for the future. I probably won't get through all of the projects given I'm now in my mid fifties with retirement still a few years away. One reason for writing this journal is to keep track of the lessons I learn, to capture the knowledge I gain with each project, and who knows, maybe it will become a helpful reference for someone once completed. It is abundantly clear to me through my research and efforts so far that woodworking is a hobby requiring continuous practice and a lifetime to achieve a high level of mastery. My intention for writing this journal is to document the thought processes and techniques used to build furniture I've designed to outlast me and to pass down from one generation to the next. I have lofty ambitions of making furniture that encompasses the lessons and techniques learned by past master furniture makers with timeless appeal and the construction to survive the rigors of everyday use. And who know, the details referenced in this journal may allow someone many decades or hundreds of years from now to perform the inevitable repairs needed to keep the furniture functional or maintain its appearance. I expect this journal will undoubtedly provide value for me, at least as a record of what I've accomplished and who knows maybe as a guide for others as well. It's all about the journey ahead.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Woodworking/002_ww_workshop/","text":"The Workshop For more than a decade before setting up my first dedicated woodworking shop, I had been reading articles in woodworking magazines that provided suggestions for the essential tools needed and ways to arrange the workspace. There was some consistency in what I read, but like everything else, everyone has their own opinion. What works for them may not work for you. As I stated in the introduction, woodworking is a life-long journey, and as your work progresses and what you need to do it continually changes. Developing new woodworking skills and the types of projects you choose to build dictates the best layout for your shop and the tools you require to accomplish the work. Use what follows as a guide, as many factors will influence the tools you purchase and the organization of your shop. One of the first considerations is the space size you have to set up shop. My current workshop is 11'6\" x 21'6\". With the table saw set up midway along the longer wall, there is just enough room to rip a full sheet of 4' x 8' plywood lengthwise. If the room were any shorter or narrower, I I could not cut sheet goods. If your room is smaller than mine and you intend to do work that requires cutting sheet goods or ripping long pieces of lumber (my lumber supplier sells primarily 14' boards) you need to consider having an alternative place to do that type of work, like a garage or outside space using a portable table saw or skill saw. Unless you intend to do small projects only and not use sheet goods, I'd suggest the minimum space needed to provide a functional woodworking shop is 12' x 22'. However, the larger, the better. A smaller shop doesn't leave much room for moving boards around or assembling large projects, but it's just enough to get by. I hope that my next house has a larger workspace You can certainly get away with a smaller workspace if you intend to build only smaller projects like boxes or small cabinets, but another thing to consider is wood storage. If you buy your wood for projects as you go or only keep a limited supply on hand, you may be able to get by, but wood does tend to accumulate. As mentioned, where I purchase lumber sells only 14' lengths or shorts, and the supply varies from visit to visit, so I buy a board just because it may not be on hand when I need it later. Also, the cutoffs and scrap pieces accumulate and may prove useful for other projects. I find it very convenient to have the wood in the workshop. Wood must be stored properly to avoid severe warping, twisting or cupping. Even kiln-dried wood, if stored improperly, may warp and twist to where it is no longer usable, causing excess waste. As wood is expensive, this is something to avoid. Proper storage is a factor in determining how much space you'll need, especially with sheet goods that take up a lot of space and require additional room to move around in the shop. Consider storing wood in the shop to acclimate at the same relative humidity as the build time. Otherwise, you may end up with unexpected results or unusable lumber. Before using newly purchased wood, I keep it in the shop for a few weeks to avoid issues. Straight out of the kiln wood has about a 6% moisture content and then depending on how long it is stored, where it is stored (inside or outside), the climate where you live, the time of year, the moisture content will be somewhat higher. A wood supply in the shop ensures stability during the construction process. If workshop wood storage is not an option, you'll want it close. My current workshop is in the basement, so bringing pieces in from the garage or outside is a pain. Purchased lumber goes straight into the shop, and sheet goods in a separate room. At times, especially at the start of a new project, the wood can pile up and get in the way, but it's generally just temporary, and I've learned to adapt while I contemplate the day I'm working in a bigger workshop. The Workbench In my opinion, the workbench is the most critical component of the workshop. A workbench should provide a stable workspace that efficiently holds a wide variety of workpieces. It sounds like a simple task, but in reality, it's far more of a challenge than you would think. My first workbench was purchased in 2012 on sale at Canadian Tire for \\$100. For the price, it seemed like a good buy as I couldn't build a workbench for that price and I thought it would fit my needs until I found or made something better. Also, to this point, I hadn't done enough woodworking to know what I'd need or how I'd be using the workbench. I'm not going to go into any great detail on workbench selection, for that topic I recommend the book Workbenches by Christopher Schwarz. Unfortunately, the Canadian Tire workbench was too small and light to be of much use. While hand planing boards, the entire workbench would move across the floor or kick up once the plane took purchase into the wood. It was of some use for specific light-duty tasks, but mostly it became a place to put my tools as I worked. Instead, I used the table saw outfeed table I built for most of my woodworking. In late 2017 after reading Workbenches , I decided to build my variation of the Roubo Workbench to fit my workshop and as a test run before building the full workbench in the future. I thoroughly enjoyed building this workbench. Many workbench designs suggest using standard stud grade lumber to save money, but I chose molding grade Pine and Ash for the top edges and the 9\" Eclipse vise. I decided not to install a tail vise thinking that I'd retrofit one if I needed to and bought a Veritas Wonder Dog to determine if it was a sufficient alternative. However, to date, I haven't made much use of the Wonder Dog or found much need for a tail vise. I added a sliding deadman for working with long boards and purchased holdfasts for clamping work to the bench. Both devices have been used for woodworking for hundreds of years, and they are the most efficient, simplest, and cheapest methods of holding boards that I have found to date. In the picture of the workbench, you'll see a Veritas Planing Stop on the benchtop in front of the vise, which is a simple and effective way to hold boards while dimensioning with a hand plane. Unlike the Canadian Tire workbench, this workbench is in constant use and I continue to adapt it as my woodworking skills improve. There are some pretty decent store-bought workbench options, but they are costly and besides the potential savings, the experience of building your workbench is worth the effort. I'll base my next workbench on the Le Roubo workbench described in the book Workbenches by Christopher Schwarz outfitted with a Benchcrafted leg vise. To purchase the Benchcrafted Benchmaker's Package in 2025 would cost $1550 USD. Hopefully, my next workbench, buying only the leg vise, will make it into this journal a few years from now. Until then, I have the plate depicting Andre Roubo's workbench from his 18th-century woodworking book L'art du Menuisier hanging on the wall of my office as inspiration.","title":"The Workshop"},{"location":"Woodworking/002_ww_workshop/#the-workshop","text":"For more than a decade before setting up my first dedicated woodworking shop, I had been reading articles in woodworking magazines that provided suggestions for the essential tools needed and ways to arrange the workspace.

In this section I'll detail the essential tools required for most woodworking without delving into specialty tools. On my first few trips to Lee Valley, when I finally started real woodworking, I went a bit crazy and bought a few things that haven't even come out of the packaging yet. I suggest getting the essential tools and adding tools as needed based on the projects you tackle. There are a couple of benefits to this approach: you won't have to put out a considerable chunk of cash all at once and you'll only get what you'll actually use. You'll probably still end up collecting a bunch of tools, some that may not get used much, but it's part of the process. The goal is to limit the wasted expense and develop an efficient approach to woodworking using select tools. For me, tools are somewhat addictive, as there is a particular attraction to sleek, high-end tools. However, basic tools work equally as well and don't discount making some of your tools. Also, pay the little bit extra for high-quality tools. Cheap tools are cheap for a reason: they may get the job done but generally aren't worth the additional frustration and poor results. I've found it's worth paying a little more to buy tried and true quality brand tools. Simple tools that are a joy to use and produce great results will be used repeatedly. Overly complicated or cheap tools tend to end up collecting dust and taking up room in your shop. Don't disregard hand tools. In the modern world, everything has become mechanized and automated. Traditional woodworking hand tools and the techniques to use them have remained the same or similar for hundreds of years in some cases. Modern steel holds an edge longer and planes have become metal-bodied instead of wood, but the function of the tools remains the same and their design and use were perfected long ago. In many cases, hand tools are quicker to use and produce better results while providing hand-crafted characteristics that are sought after in antiques. There are a couple of machines I wouldn't do without, but they aren't necessary to produce exceptional furniture. Hand Tools I love tools and have accumulated a considerable number over the years, new and antique. Quality tools solve a lot of problems and keeping them sharp will solve a lot of others. Also, I've learned that the right tool for the job can significantly improve the results and reduce frustration. The small remainder of the problems are alleviated by learning how to use the tools correctly and through practice. When I first started purchasing hand tools for woodworking, my initial impression was that Lee Valley tools were expensive. However, after more than a decade of buying tools, I find their tools are reasonably priced. The Veritas brand is Canadian and is of high quality. Also, when the Canadian dollar is well below the US dollar, Lee Valley provides one of the only reasonable options to American retailers that on top of exchange would charge for shipping and duty. As an alternative, Amazon.ca is worth checking but usually has a more limited selection of tools than the US site - the price we pay for living in a vast country with a small population. I've listed several planes as essential. Most modern woodworkers have never used a hand plane, instead four-squaring boards by machines. While I may do the bulk of the grunt work by machine or use a machine to deal with difficult grain, nothing produces a better finished board with little need to sand than a hand plane. Make an effort to learn how to use hand planes, as they are an indispensable part of my work. As mentioned above, if I had only one machine tool, it would be a table saw. Maybe it's because I don't enjoy using a hand saw, but it is mostly a matter of function, time, and effort. Hand-tool methods provide a greater understanding of wood, grain characteristics, and other factors. Also, hand-tool work is far safer than machine tools and produces less air-born dust. Woodworking is about enjoying the work and the process as much as building furniture. It is certainly not unreasonable to run an unplugged workshop. I find that over time and as I try new techniques, I gravitate more and more to hand-tool work. Working with hand tools is faster, produces better results, and is a more satisfying experience. There isn't a huge number of tools needed to accomplish fine woodwork. Incredible work is possible with just the essentials, despite the crazy number of tools you see in the workshops depicted in magazines and online. As I've suggested, buy tools as you go.

Most people haven't heard of 1-2-3 blocks and they are more commonly found in machinist shops but are well suited to woodworking. Small to the inch measurements are often needed and 1-2-3 blocks make for a quick and efficient machine setup. The blocks I have are heavy and if dropped on a workbench or workpiece, they can leave a very deep dent, so I built a box out of a scrap piece of ash to hold them and make it easier to transport. Clamps Woodworking clamps come in a wide variety and are an item you will find in large quantities in most woodworking shops. Proper work holding capabilities and glue-ups are essential for producing quality work. A significant component of your workbench design is allowing for proper clamping and securing of the wood while you work. The basic rule of thumb is, you can never have too many clamps. I use multiple sizes of each type of clamp listed below. Cabinet and panel glue-ups Jorgensen Cabinet Master Parallel Jaw Bar clamp Bessey Parallel clamps General glue-up and clamping Dubuque Aluminum Bar clamp - lightweight and the clamps I use the most for glue-ups Homemade Cam clamps when lighter clamping pressure is required Bar Clamps Work Holding Irwin Quick Clamps Bessey UniKlamp C clamps Veritas Wonder Dog Gramercy Holdfasts -- quick and versatile work holding","title":"Hand Tools"},{"location":"Woodworking/003_ww_handtools/#essential-hand-tools","text":"The workspace you have available and the type of work you do will dictate the tools you purchase.

Most people haven't heard of 1-2-3 blocks and they are more commonly found in machinist shops but are well suited to woodworking. Small to the inch measurements are often needed and 1-2-3 blocks make for a quick and efficient machine setup.

The table saw is where much of my work takes place. I use the table saw to rough cut when dimensioning lumber, which only requires a quick run of a plane to remove the saw marks. And to square up the edge, rip stock to thickness, cut mitres, dadoes, finger joints, and cross-cutting with a sled. With a variety of jigs and blade options, table saws are extremely versatile.

Outfeed Table If space permits, add an outfeed table behind your table saw. It makes it much safer to use the table saw and it provides extra workspace in the shop. Dust Control If you are using woodworking machines and power tools in your house, then it is best to consider a way to control dust. The relatively cheap and simple approach I've taken in my basement workshop is using a Shop Vac connected to a DustRIGHT Vortex controlled with a power controller. When I turn on my table saw or any other tools I have plugged into the controller, the vacuum is turned on as well and runs for five seconds after the power is turned off. The Vortex collects 90% of the saw dust which limits the amount the goes into the Shop Vac and into the air of the shop. I bought additional hoses and adapters to connect to different tools (orbital sander, router table, bandsaw, plate joiner, and planer). Even with dust collection, there is still a significant amount of saw dust that escapes. Also, my shop has a cold air return in it, so I put a filter over the vent to prevent air born saw dust from circulating through the house.

Looking back, I don't know how I worked without them. One of the main reasons I wouldn't dispense with my table saw is due to the number of jigs I use to increase its versatility. Jigs are a vital part of your woodworking arsenal with widely varied purposes that add simplicity, accuracy, safety, and efficiency to your woodworking. My jigs and aids inventory, typically made from scraps of plywood or MDF continues to grow. There are far too many jigs to cover here and the jigs you build depends on the tools and machinery you use in your shop and the types of furniture you make. I've highlighted the main jigs I use and will cover others in this journal specific to the various projects. A shooting board helps produce exact and true edges for gluing. There are three common types: joint and square, mitre, and donkey's ear. The one I've built is a combined joint and square and mitre shooting board. The stop prevents chip-out on the far side as the plane blade exits the wood. I use one most often for squaring the end of boards and edges on smaller pieces, such as for box construction. Using a shooting board requires some practice to adjust the plane properly to remove just the right amount of shaving and develop a feel for feeding the board into the plane. Once you get the hang of it, the technique produces fantastic results quickly. French Cleats French cleats are a simple and excellent way to add a lot of flexibility and versatility to your workshop. A French cleat is a moulding with a 30\u00ba to 45\u00ba slope attached to the wall that provides a way to secure objects to a wall. A matching edge moulding is attached to the back of an object and then hooked onto the wall cleat. In my workshop, I use French cleats to hang wood racks, a clamp rack, a tool rack, and a nail gun cabinet. Nail Gun Cabinet Nail guns and other items were starting to pile up in my workshop, so I built a cabinet to store them out of the way. Unintentionally yet conveniently, the slots for the nail gun are large enough to serve a dual purpose, housing a nail gun and a cordless drill in a single slot. The bottom shelf holds the cordless drill chargers and other items, and the top of the cabinet provides additional storage for often-used items. I built this cabinet with pieces of scrap pine plywood. Sandpaper Organizer For years, I've had sandpaper piled up on a corner of my workbench, so one day I decided to make an organizer to clean up the constant mess. Using scrap plywood I quickly design it to hold full sheets, half sheets, quarter sheets, and various sanding blocks. Handmade tools I've always admired the idea of making hand tools but was intimidated by the intricacy and accuracy that is required. The ability to create and customize unique, beautiful, and useable tools appeals to me. I took the opportunity to make hand tools during the COVID-19 quarantine. I was building projects to reduce the accumulated scrap wood and came across a small block of olivewood that I thought was suitable for a small try square handle. In less than an hour I built a beautiful and accurate try square. Next up was a spokeshave. I ordered a large spokeshave hardware kit from Lee Valley and used the detailed instructions provided to make it. I started with four wood blanks made with various types of wood. I scrapped a couple of blanks along the way due to the poor suitability of the wood. The final spokeshave shown below used maple, which is best. My handmade spokeshave works far better than the cheap Stanley spokeshave I've been using. Encouraged by the results of the try square and spokeshave, I ordered two plane kits to make a smooth plane and a jointer plane. I'd been looking to purchase used or antique planes but wasn't finding what I wanted at a reasonable price. I figured it was worth trying to make my own. I used walnut to make the blanks, but the finished thickness was about a \u00bc\" less than indicated in the plans, which became a problem later in the build. To correct the problem, I glued Caribbean rosewood to the bottom of the planes. I'm doubtful this will hold up over time due to laminating two different wood types, but if I need to, I'll make new plane bodies. I used the design in the plans for the smooth plane but decided to build a razee-style jointer plane. When the time came to sharpen the blades, set up the planes and test them out, I was absolutely shocked at how well they worked. The blade adjustment capabilities of the kit add a modern improvement to traditional wooden planes, so setting the blade for a proper cut is easy. Given the large size of the jointer plane, I was surprised at how light it was, which took some adjustment to get used to. I guess I've gotten used to metal planes with significantly more mass. I had just purchased some carving chisels, so I decided to add decoration to the jointer plane handle. I thought it better to try carving on a tool that wouldn't matter as much before carving a piece of furniture. I didn't get the results I was hoping for, but I think it's a pretty cool and unique-looking plane. Best of all, both planes are excellent to work with.","title":"Jigs and Aids"},{"location":"Woodworking/005_ww_jigs-aids/#woodworking-jigs-and-aids","text":"Throughout high school woodworking classes and my earlier projects, I hadn't picked up on the value of using jigs.

A project can take a long time to complete, painstakingly ensuring all joinery is cleanly cut, square, and solid. However, you can very quickly ruin the results with a poor application or choice of finish. Once applied, it is difficult and labour-intensive to remove most finishes. I've tried several different finishes and application techniques with varying results. Below are details of finishes and techniques I've used successfully and when I chose one option over another. For my projects, I prefer using clear finishes to bring out the natural colour of the wood. For the occasional project that uses a stain, I haven't encountered many difficulties applying a stain. However, be conscious of the wood's ability to accept specific stain types and follow the vendor's instructions. Preparation An excellent finish begins with proper surface preparation. Long before applying the first coat of finish, there is a lot of work that has to take place to ensure the best results. Any flaw in the construction process or in the wood preparation is amplified when applying the finish, such as tool marks, glue overflow, or even scratch marks from not using a fine enough sandpaper grit. Recommended Preparation Steps Smooth plane visible surfaces before assembly, which significantly reduces or eliminates the need to sand. The surface left by a finely tuned smooth plane is pristine and ready for finish or, at worst, requires only a light sanding with the finest grit sandpaper. Guard against or thoroughly clean up glue squeeze-out. Most woodworking glues seal the wood, preventing stains and finishes from penetrating and leaving visible discolouration and blemishes in the finish that mar the appearance of the piece. Avoiding the finishing issue due to glue squeeze-out is a crucial step to ensuring a high-quality finish. Once the glue has dried on the wood, it is challenging and time-consuming to properly remove without damaging the wood surface below. a. Cut tenons just short (1/6\" to 1/8\") of the mortise depth to leave room for extra glue and prevent squeeze-out. Also, chamfer the edges of a tenon. b. Cover the edges of a joint with painter's tape to prevent the glue squeeze-out from going on the wood and leaving only a very fine glue line after removing the tape. Just like painting, it is essential to remove the tape while the glue is still wet. c. Glue up panels at a thickness greater than the finished thickness. The additional thickness allows for the final planing of the surface either by hand or by machine to remove unsightly glue lines. A card scraper or chisel plane is useful for cleaning panel glue lines before planing. d. Let the glue set for about 30 minutes and then carefully remove the glue with a sharp-edged tool. An old half-inch chisel works great and allows me to get into corners. If timed correctly, the glue will pull off reasonably cleanly from the wood joint. e. Avoid using water to wipe away freshly squeezed-out glue, unless using hide glue where warm water dissolves the glue sufficiently to avoid leaving a glue stain. f. It's almost impossible to avoid all glue squeeze-outs even deploying the preventive measures above, so if you miss a spot and the glue has already set too far, leave it to harden fully. Once fully set, use a very sharp chisel to remove the glue, being very careful not to dig into the wood below. The glue usually cracks off the surface, leaving it reasonably clean, and removing the remaining glue altogether requires a little sanding. Sand with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper. With my usual surface preparation, I can typically start sanding with 220 grit, then follow with 320 using a cork sanding block. In cases on final surfaces prepared with a smooth plane, it only requires a light sanding with 320 grit sandpaper or a sanding pad. In rare cases and only for isolated spots, usually difficult grain, I'll start at 180 grit followed with a card scraper to create a finish-ready surface. Be aware that certain types of wood only work with specific or limited stain types or finishes. Also, some woods may require a pore filler or sealer before finishing. Do your research when working with new wood species. I've only used a sealer once and wasn't satisfied with the results. In most cases, a coat of shellac works as a sealer if needed but some open pored woods benefit from using a filler. a. Maple requires an aniline dye to colour. b. Cherry can be challenging to avoid blotching. Preferred Clear Coat Finishes I work mostly with three types of finishes depending on the project and its intended use. My first choice is a rub-on, oil-based varnish which is all-natural, looks great, and is the easiest to apply. Next would be shellac, which again is all-natural but can be challenging to apply with flawless results. For projects that require greater protection from moisture or heavy use, I use a water-based polyurethane finish. There are countless types of finishes and techniques for finishing wood but as I prefer the natural beauty of the wood, I limit myself to the three finishes mentioned above. With these finishes, adding artist pigments to enhance the wood's colour allows for applying the stain and finish all in one go. It also allows you to adjust the tint or colouring with subsequent layers and possibly make adjustments to achieve the intended finish results. Milk paint is a finish I intend to try, which is another all-natural finish that will have to wait for the right project. Varnish Oil My introduction to varnish oil came when I took a one-day sharpening class at the Unplugged Workshop in Toronto on March 21st, 2017, conducted by Tom Fidgen. After learning to sharpen a plane blade, we prepared and dimensioned boards to create a bench hook that we finished with varnish oil. I purchased a can of Tried and True varnish oil that day and have been using it with excellent results ever since. Buffing results in an extremely smooth-to-the-touch, lustrous finish. Warning A word of caution, varnish oil is known to combust spontaneously, so dispose of all rags used during the application process sealed in a plastic bag to prevent exposure to oxygen. A woodworking shop is the last place you want spontaneous combustion to occur. Application: Apply a thin coat with a lint-free cloth. Let it sit for at least an hour to allow the oil to penetrate the wood. Rub with a lint-free cloth until the surface is completely dry. Allow 24 hours to cure, occasionally checking for spots that require additional rubbing to remove excess. Burnish with a soft cloth and add a second coat repeating the steps above. Note Most boiled linseed oils are not in fact boiled, but instead use harmful additives. Tried and True Varnish Oil uses pure boiled linseed oil and natural resins, making is safe to apply and food safe as well.

It is processed and sold as dry flakes that are dissolved in alcohol to make liquid shellac. I ran a Google search for shellac and the top links provided were all related to fingernail polish, which signifies that it has fallen out of favour as a wood finish. Given shellac's non-toxic nature, it has been used as a coating for candy and pharmaceuticals for years and dates back as a wood finish for over 3000 years. As a wood finish, dry shellac flakes are available in several different grades that delineate the level of refinement. Dewaxed shellac is best as a wood finish, as wax-laced shellac can cause adhesion problems. Dewaxed shellac works as an excellent sealer over stains to prevent bleeding and is compatible under varnish and polyurethane. You can also use shellac over an oil finish, such as linseed oil, that produces an immediate antique appearance on new wood. While the varnish oil finish discussed first is the easiest to apply, shellac provides the best-looking finish that brings out the natural colour and figure of the wood while providing better protection. For me, the great depth and sheen flexibility, from satin to high gloss depending on the application shellac produces, has no equal among modern finishes. Shellac's consistency is determined by \"cut.\" I usually mix a 2 lb. cut to start. A 2 lb. cut is 2 lbs. of shellac flakes per U.S. gallon of denatured alcohol solvent. Shellac is usually not mixed by the gallon for my use, especially since shellac has a limited shelf life. A 2 lb. cut is a 1:4 ratio, so add 1 oz. of shellac flakes to 4 fl. oz. of denatured alcohol, occasionally shaking until all of the flakes have dissolved, usually overnight is sufficient. Shellac is best used fresh, so I only mix quantities I'll use and never use it if more than a couple of months old. If shellac is too old, it won't cure and remains soft and tacky. Also, the longer shellac resin remains in alcohol, the more water-sensitive it becomes through esterification. Higher shellac ester increases water sensitivity and prevents the resin from drying hard. Long story short, for the most protective and best shellac finish possible, use freshly mixed shellac. After the shellac has dissolved, filter it through fine-meshed cheesecloth before use to remove impurities. Depending on the level of refinement, some mixtures may not need filtering, but it's worth doing anyway. Shellac can be applied through many different methods, brush, pad, or spray. A reason for using a thinner cut of shellac is that heavier cuts dry very rapidly and even though it will be dry to the touch within 10 or 15 minutes, wait a while before applying another coat. If you miss a spot, wait for that coat to dry thoroughly before attempting to go over it. I usually don't apply more than three thin coats per day. If you don't allow adequate drying time between coats, the finish may remain soft for weeks. Temperature and humidity conditions may impact the application and drying times of shellac. During the summer, I'll apply shellac in the cool basement during early morning or late evening hours just to be safe. Another benefit to using shellac is that it is easy to maintain and repair as new shellac will adhere to old shellac without any problems. Each layer of shellac partially dissolves the layers below it. Water rings can usually be removed by wiping the spot with alcohol or lightly sand the area and apply a fresh coat of shellac. Application: For the first few coats, apply a 1 lb cut with a brush or pad. With either, load the applicator with shellac and run it with the grain from one edge to the other with smooth continuous overlapping strokes. If brushing use a high-quality brush with a chisel tip To make a polishing pad, make a tight ball of gauze or cheesecloth, a little smaller than the size of a golf ball. Then take a 6\" x 6\" piece of clean cotton and fold the four corners up to meet at the top in a teardrop shape. Twist into a snug ball and use a strip of cloth or string to tie the pad. The pad acts as a reservoir for the shellac. Let the shellac cure for at least two hours between coats Sand with 400 grit sandpaper Vacuum and wipe clean with a tack cloth to remove excess dust Repeat the steps above as required. For later coats, use the full 2 lb. cut. I usually use five or six coats for the whole piece and an additional three or four coats for the tops or surfaces that are used more heavily, such as tabletops. Shell 2 lb. Cut Recipe: 1 oz. dewaxed shellac flakes 4 oz. denatured alcohol (Lee Valley Shellac/Lacquer Thinner) Stir occasionally until all the shellac flakes have dissolved Filter through fine-meshed cheesecloth or paint filter before use Note: Use a sealed glass jar to mix and store. Modern Finishes When extra protection is required, I used a water-based polyurethane finish which is essentially liquid plastic. They provide a decent finish that is reasonably easy to apply and clean up after, just follow the vendor's instructions on the label and don't brush too fast as it can create air bubbles that mar the finish. Cabinet Finishes I recently renovated my kitchen and built all new kitchen cabinets. To finish the cabinets I tried Benjamin Moore's Stays Clear acrylic polyurethane for the interior clear finish and Advance paint for the painted exterior parts. The Stays Clear finish looks great when applied with a brush or sprayed. The Advance paint looks better sprayed on, but it needs to be thinned to do so. I used a 20% water to 80% paint ratio and an HVLP 2.3 mm spray gun. Also, the Advance paint has a seven-day cure time which is not ideal under time constraints. Once cured, Advance paint is durable and cleans easily. UV-cured Paint For my next painted cabinet project, I will try UV-cured paint. UV-cured paint is a type of paint that uses ultraviolet (UV) light to trigger a chemical reaction that causes the paint to harden almost instantly. Other advantages include a higher gloss finish and resistance to chipping and damage.","title":"Finishing"},{"location":"Woodworking/006_ww_finishing/#finishing","text":"Finishing is the step that can make or break the final results of a project. A project can take a long time to complete, painstakingly ensuring all joinery is cleanly cut, square, and solid. However, you can very quickly ruin the results with a poor application or choice of finish. Once applied, it is difficult and labour-intensive to remove most finishes. I've tried several different finishes and application techniques with varying results. Below are details of finishes and techniques I've used successfully and when I chose one option over another. For my projects, I prefer using clear finishes to bring out the natural colour of the wood. For the occasional project that uses a stain, I haven't encountered many difficulties applying a stain. However, be conscious of the wood's ability to accept specific stain types and follow the vendor's instructions.","title":"Finishing"},{"location":"Woodworking/006_ww_finishing/#preparation","text":"An excellent finish begins with proper surface preparation. Long before applying the first coat of finish, there is a lot of work that has to take place to ensure the best results. Any flaw in the construction process or in the wood preparation is amplified when applying the finish, such as tool marks, glue overflow, or even scratch marks from not using a fine enough sandpaper grit.","title":"Preparation"},{"location":"Woodworking/006_ww_finishing/#recommended-preparation-steps","text":"Smooth plane visible surfaces before assembly, which significantly reduces or eliminates the need to sand. The surface left by a finely tuned smooth plane is pristine and ready for finish or, at worst, requires only a light sanding with the finest grit sandpaper. Guard against or thoroughly clean up glue squeeze-out. Most woodworking glues seal the wood, preventing stains and finishes from penetrating and leaving visible discolouration and blemishes in the finish that mar the appearance of the piece. Avoiding the finishing issue due to glue squeeze-out is a crucial step to ensuring a high-quality finish. Once the glue has dried on the wood, it is challenging and time-consuming to properly remove without damaging the wood surface below. a. Cut tenons just short (1/6\" to 1/8\") of the mortise depth to leave room for extra glue and prevent squeeze-out. Also, chamfer the edges of a tenon. b. Cover the edges of a joint with painter's tape to prevent the glue squeeze-out from going on the wood and leaving only a very fine glue line after removing the tape. Just like painting, it is essential to remove the tape while the glue is still wet. c. Glue up panels at a thickness greater than the finished thickness. The additional thickness allows for the final planing of the surface either by hand or by machine to remove unsightly glue lines. A card scraper or chisel plane is useful for cleaning panel glue lines before planing. d. Let the glue set for about 30 minutes and then carefully remove the glue with a sharp-edged tool. An old half-inch chisel works great and allows me to get into corners. If timed correctly, the glue will pull off reasonably cleanly from the wood joint. e. Avoid using water to wipe away freshly squeezed-out glue, unless using hide glue where warm water dissolves the glue sufficiently to avoid leaving a glue stain. f. It's almost impossible to avoid all glue squeeze-outs even deploying the preventive measures above, so if you miss a spot and the glue has already set too far, leave it to harden fully. Once fully set, use a very sharp chisel to remove the glue, being very careful not to dig into the wood below. The glue usually cracks off the surface, leaving it reasonably clean, and removing the remaining glue altogether requires a little sanding. Sand with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper. With my usual surface preparation, I can typically start sanding with 220 grit, then follow with 320 using a cork sanding block. In cases on final surfaces prepared with a smooth plane, it only requires a light sanding with 320 grit sandpaper or a sanding pad. In rare cases and only for isolated spots, usually difficult grain, I'll start at 180 grit followed with a card scraper to create a finish-ready surface. Be aware that certain types of wood only work with specific or limited stain types or finishes. Also, some woods may require a pore filler or sealer before finishing. Do your research when working with new wood species. I've only used a sealer once and wasn't satisfied with the results. In most cases, a coat of shellac works as a sealer if needed but some open pored woods benefit from using a filler. a. Maple requires an aniline dye to colour. b. Cherry can be challenging to avoid blotching.","title":"Recommended Preparation Steps"},{"location":"Woodworking/006_ww_finishing/#preferred-clear-coat-finishes","text":"I work mostly with three types of finishes depending on the project and its intended use. My first choice is a rub-on, oil-based varnish which is all-natural, looks great, and is the easiest to apply. Next would be shellac, which again is all-natural but can be challenging to apply with flawless results. For projects that require greater protection from moisture or heavy use, I use a water-based polyurethane finish. There are countless types of finishes and techniques for finishing wood but as I prefer the natural beauty of the wood, I limit myself to the three finishes mentioned above. With these finishes, adding artist pigments to enhance the wood's colour allows for applying the stain and finish all in one go. It also allows you to adjust the tint or colouring with subsequent layers and possibly make adjustments to achieve the intended finish results. Milk paint is a finish I intend to try, which is another all-natural finish that will have to wait for the right project.","title":"Preferred Clear Coat Finishes"},{"location":"Woodworking/006_ww_finishing/#varnish-oil","text":"My introduction to varnish oil came when I took a one-day sharpening class at the Unplugged Workshop in Toronto on March 21st, 2017, conducted by Tom Fidgen.

I purchased a can of Tried and True varnish oil that day and have been using it with excellent results ever since. Buffing results in an extremely smooth-to-the-touch, lustrous finish. Warning A word of caution, varnish oil is known to combust spontaneously, so dispose of all rags used during the application process sealed in a plastic bag to prevent exposure to oxygen.

It is processed and sold as dry flakes that are dissolved in alcohol to make liquid shellac. I ran a Google search for shellac and the top links provided were all related to fingernail polish, which signifies that it has fallen out of favour as a wood finish. Given shellac's non-toxic nature, it has been used as a coating for candy and pharmaceuticals for years and dates back as a wood finish for over 3000 years. As a wood finish, dry shellac flakes are available in several different grades that delineate the level of refinement. Dewaxed shellac is best as a wood finish, as wax-laced shellac can cause adhesion problems. Dewaxed shellac works as an excellent sealer over stains to prevent bleeding and is compatible under varnish and polyurethane. You can also use shellac over an oil finish, such as linseed oil, that produces an immediate antique appearance on new wood. While the varnish oil finish discussed first is the easiest to apply, shellac provides the best-looking finish that brings out the natural colour and figure of the wood while providing better protection. For me, the great depth and sheen flexibility, from satin to high gloss depending on the application shellac produces, has no equal among modern finishes. Shellac's consistency is determined by \"cut.\" I usually mix a 2 lb. cut to start. A 2 lb. cut is 2 lbs. of shellac flakes per U.S. gallon of denatured alcohol solvent. Shellac is usually not mixed by the gallon for my use, especially since shellac has a limited shelf life. A 2 lb. cut is a 1:4 ratio, so add 1 oz. of shellac flakes to 4 fl. oz. of denatured alcohol, occasionally shaking until all of the flakes have dissolved, usually overnight is sufficient. Shellac is best used fresh, so I only mix quantities I'll use and never use it if more than a couple of months old. If shellac is too old, it won't cure and remains soft and tacky. Also, the longer shellac resin remains in alcohol, the more water-sensitive it becomes through esterification. Higher shellac ester increases water sensitivity and prevents the resin from drying hard. Long story short, for the most protective and best shellac finish possible, use freshly mixed shellac. After the shellac has dissolved, filter it through fine-meshed cheesecloth before use to remove impurities. Depending on the level of refinement, some mixtures may not need filtering, but it's worth doing anyway. Shellac can be applied through many different methods, brush, pad, or spray. A reason for using a thinner cut of shellac is that heavier cuts dry very rapidly and even though it will be dry to the touch within 10 or 15 minutes, wait a while before applying another coat. If you miss a spot, wait for that coat to dry thoroughly before attempting to go over it. I usually don't apply more than three thin coats per day. If you don't allow adequate drying time between coats, the finish may remain soft for weeks. Temperature and humidity conditions may impact the application and drying times of shellac. During the summer, I'll apply shellac in the cool basement during early morning or late evening hours just to be safe. Another benefit to using shellac is that it is easy to maintain and repair as new shellac will adhere to old shellac without any problems. Each layer of shellac partially dissolves the layers below it. Water rings can usually be removed by wiping the spot with alcohol or lightly sand the area and apply a fresh coat of shellac.","title":"Shellac"},{"location":"Woodworking/006_ww_finishing/#application_1","text":"For the first few coats, apply a 1 lb cut with a brush or pad.

The key is to employ a system that allows for the expansion and contraction of the tabletop through the seasons. Depending on the type of wood and the width of the tabletop, considerable wood movement is possible and the proper attachment is critical to counteract the resulting stress that can be applied to a table. Z-clips The first and easiest method uses Z-clips (Lee Valley Tabletop Clamps). Cut a groove into the table sides (rails) to insert the Z-clip into, then screw the clip to the underside of the table.
