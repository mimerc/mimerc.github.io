So after a lot of research I decided to purchase a speaker kit from GR Research. However, like many industries during Covid impacted by supply chain shortages, the only kit available was for the Desktop \"Mini\". No problem, I'd never used a soldering iron before and it was the cheapest kit in the line up, so it seemed like the perfect choice. Note: The Desktop \"Mini\" is now discontinued and has been replaced by the LGK. Watch a few of GR Research's videos and you'll soon understand the benefits of building your own speakers. There truly is great bang for the buck and the satisfaction of doing it yourself. You'll need some tools to ensure a successful build, but overall the experience and results are worth the expense and effort. Although you can't buy the Desktop \"Mini\", these steps are still applicable for most DIY speaker kits. Recommended Tools 4 Irwin Quick-Grip clamps (or similar) or Dubuque Aluminum Bar Clamps (size will depend on your speaker kit) Router with a 3/4\" round bit Router table (optional) Disposable sponge roller Soldering Iron Heat gun Drill and 1/4\" drill bit Torque and Phillips screwdrivers (size will vary depending on scew sizes) Additional Requirements Wood Glue 220 sand paper 1 sheet of No Rez or insulation DuraTex Plastic Bags (Optional depending on the Duratex finish) 1 can of spray paint (colour of your choice) Zip ties 8 3/4\" wood screws Building the Speakers Assembling the Speaker Boxes Even though these are small speakers, gluing up the boxes can be a challenge. Lay out the speaker box pieces and do a dry run prior to the glue up. Also, determine the position the clamps and set them to fit in preparation. Note: I placed the clamps to clamp the sides together on all four corners. Glue the pieces together in the following order: Apply glue to the bottom dadoes. Apply glue to the left side dadoes, connect it to the back, and then set into the bottom. Apply glue to the right side dadoes, and connect it to the previous assembly. Connect the front. Apply glue to the top dadoes and complete the box assembly. Clamp the speaker and remove any excess glue squeeze out. Repeat for the second speaker. Finishing the Speaker Boxes Sand the joints to ensure they are smooth so that the joint lines are hidden when finished. Rounding the speaker edges is optional but highly recommended. It reduces refraction and makes the speakers more durable to dings and dents. I used a 3/4\" round bit with my router set in a router table. Given the small size of the speakers using a router table makes the task much safer and easier. I rounded the front and side edges with the router. I left the back edges as is and just soften the edges by lightly sanding them. Apply DuraTex with a disposable sponge roller to all sides, excluding the back of the speakers. While the DuraTex is still wet dab it with a balled up plastic bag to provide a nice knockdown textured finish. Apply three coats of spray paint in the desired colour. My son chose this colour, Behr Paint+Primer Flirt Alert (red). Assembling the Crossovers Twist connect the crossover components together so that they fit the crossover board. Mark the location of the four screw holes to mount the crossover board to the speaker and to zip tie the components to the board. Drill the holes in the crossover board. Solder the crossover component connects. Attach the crossover components to the board with zip ties. Solder the speaker wire connections. Use a heat gun to shrink-tube the speaker wire connections on the crossover assembly. Final Assembly Attach the crossover to the bottom of the speakers with 3/4\" wood screws. This step is the trickiest part of the build due to the small size of the speaker opening. An angled electric screw driver can greatly simplify this step. Insulate the speaker cabinet walls. I used insulation I had on hand, but will use No Rez in future builds. Attach, solder, and shrink-tube the binding post and speaker connections. Attach the binding post insert and speakers to the cabinet with the screws provided.","title":"Desktop Mini"},{"location":"Audiophilia/DesktopMini/#desktop-mini-build","text":"GR Research Speakers I've wanted to build a pair of speakers for a very long time and during Covid I was looking for a project to work on.

Combine all of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce in a small bowl and stir until smooth. Pour 1/3 of the sauce (about 1/2 cup) over the short ribs. Using tongs, flip the ribs over and spoon another 1/3 of the sauce over top. Reserve the remaining BBQ sauce to spoon over the cooked ribs. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and roast for 2-1/2 hours. Remove the foil and, if the cooking liquid is covering the meat, use a large spoon or ladle to remove some of the liquid so that the tops are exposed.

Ingredients 1 1/2 cups ham , roughly chopped 1/2 tbsp olive oil 3 tbsp butter 1 garlic clove , minced 1 small onion , diced (or half large onion) (yellow, brown or white) 2 potatoes , peeled and diced into 8mm / 1/3\" cubes 1 1/2 cups frozen corn (or drained canned corn) 5 tbsp flour 2 cups milk (I use low fat but full fat will work too) 1 cup chicken stock 1 1/2 - 2 cups water 1/2 tsp salt Black pepper Instructions Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes until translucent. Do not let the onion brown. Add the flour and whisk until mixed through the butter. Pour 1 cup of milk in and whisk until it starts to thicken (around 1 1/2 minutes), then pour the remaining cup of milk in. Whisk until it thickens - around 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Then add the chicken stock, and 1 1/2 cups of water and whisk until combined. Increase heat to medium high and add the potatoes into the soup. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, whisking fairly regularly to ensure the soup doesn't stick to the bottom of the saucepan. The soup will thicken as it cooks. Use the remaining 1/2 cup of water if the soup gets too thick before the potato has finished cooking. Just before the potato has finished cooking, add the corn in (just to heat it through). While the potato is cooking, heat olive oil in a small fry pan over high heat. Add the ham and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes until nicely browned. Remove fry pan from the heat and set aside. When the potato is cooked (tender but still holding its shape), remove the soup from the stove and stir through ham (reserve a bit for garnish). If the soup is too thick for your liking, use water (or milk) to get the soup to your desired consistency. Add the salt and 5 grinds of black pepper, then do a taste test and adjust the saltiness if required. Serve, garnished with remaining ham.","title":"Ham Corn Chowder"},{"location":"Recipes/HamCornChowder/#ham-and-corn-chowder","text":"An easy chowder recipe to use up leftover ham.","title":"Ham and Corn Chowder"},{"location":"Recipes/HamCornChowder/#ingredients","text":"1 1/2 cups ham , roughly chopped 1/2 tbsp olive oil 3 tbsp butter 1 garlic clove , minced 1 small onion , diced (or half large onion) (yellow, brown or white) 2 potatoes , peeled and diced into 8mm / 1/3\" cubes 1 1/2 cups frozen corn (or drained canned corn) 5 tbsp flour 2 cups milk (I use low fat but full fat will work too) 1 cup chicken stock 1 1/2 - 2 cups water 1/2 tsp salt Black pepper","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"Recipes/HamCornChowder/#instructions","text":"Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Once a week, we were bused to a local school for woodworking, home economics, or art. My first project was a reasonably simple sculpture that didn't require any exceptional skills. Starting with dimensioned lumber, I used a hand saw to cut the two pieces I needed to size, the main sculpture and a base. The two parts were shaped with a bandsaw, and then I used a rasp and sandpaper to refine the cut edges. A hole was drilled into each piece, then a short dowel was used to connect them. A quick stain and I'd completed my first woodworking project. Concorde 1979 The inspiration for my sculpture came from the Concorde, which at the time was a relatively new French-British turbojet-powered supersonic airliner, capable of a maximum speed of over twice the speed of sound. The following year I stepped it up a notch, making a pair of bookends that combined my woodworking and art projects. I added basic joinery to my repertoire using butt joints to assemble the bookends. In art class, I drew a running elk and pressed the image onto thin copper plates, which I stained and attached to the bookends with brass brads. These bookends have adorned my bookshelves everywhere I've lived, except Japan, since 1980. Bookends 1980 I continued woodworking throughout high school. Taking woodworking classes happened somewhat through fate. Every year I tried to take Auto Shop or Electricity; however, I was an Advanced student, so the General level students got priority for shop classes. Inevitably, during the first week of classes, I would be kicked out so General level students could take my spot, leaving woodworking as my only option, which I guess was less popular than the other shop classes. I ended up getting six high school credits for woodworking, which developed the foundation of my skills and started a lifelong passion for a hobby I hope to enjoy in retirement as a more full-time endeavor between rounds of golf. Grade nine brought an introduction to hand tools where we took raw lumber and had to dimension and finish some of the pieces by hand. For most of the other work, we were allowed to use the shop machinery. Oddly, for this project and the cabinet I built in grade eleven, I used willow. I liked the colour and grain, but most of all I chose it because it was the cheapest wood available for purchase in our woodworking class. In all my trips to lumber yards since I've never encountered willow as an option to purchase, nor have I come across an article in a woodworking magazine or book that mentions willow as a wood choice for building furniture. Maybe willow's availability was due to being in the Niagara Region, which had a lot of willows lining the shores of the rivers in the area. End Table 1981 In the grade ten woodworking class, we built a toolbox, which introduced hinged joints and was my first project using plywood. It sat empty for twenty-five years until we moved into our first house and I started buying tools for home renovations. Tool Box 1982 Grade eleven involved a much larger project. I built a cabinet from plans I found in a magazine. I was quite satisfied with the build; however, I was in a rush at the end of the project and selected a poor finish. I've always intended to strip and redo the cabinet finish but never got around to it. Cabinet 1984 For the top, I selected the best figured wood. However, once finished and ready for assembly, I agonized over which side to use. The original pristine side turned out exactly as I wanted, and the opposite side intended to face inward was flawed with rot hollows. In the end, I chose the flawed side because I thought it added character to the piece. Overall the rot details enhanced the intended rustic appearance of the cabinet and added an immediate sense of age. Going with the alternate side was a decision I've never regretted and continue to make similar choices on projects in the constant battle between my perfectionist nature and artistic instinct. Cabinet Top & The Beauty of Natural Flaws The grade twelve woodworking class project was a step stool. The challenge was working out joinery that involved joints intersecting at compound angles. The stool still resides in my shop and is as structurally stable as the day I built it, although now it has a more distressed look from use. High school woodworking classes provided the foundation for my furniture making and construction knowledge, skills that have served me well throughout my life. Step Stool 1985 On the commute into work this morning, I heard on the radio that most millennials have never used basic tools such as a screwdriver or hammer and rely on their fathers for assistance. Trades and hand tool skills appear to be in decline, but I've moved in the opposite direction, preferring to do renovations and build furniture myself. I rarely see a piece of store-bought furniture that I'd purchase by choice and prefer to find a quality antique or make it myself. The savings gained doing the renovations myself leaves extra budget for high-end finishing and more flexibility for customization. Also, I struggle with paying someone for subpar work and only bring in help if a job requires specialized skills or equipment, or to save time. Home renovations began with our first house, purchased in 1997 in Acton, ON. At first, I think my wife was skeptical of my capabilities and some of the projects I pursued, but over time and after seeing the results, she came to trust that I would get the job done. The only concession was that it often took a long time, and as a result, our houses were always in some form of half-completed renovation and rarely in a state of completion to satisfy her requirements to host parties. Following high school, my woodworking took an extended hiatus (1987-2001). I spent several years in university and college, lived in Japan for a year, began my career, got married, and started a family. During that period, I kept an eye out for furniture I liked and kept a mental list of furniture projects I wanted to tackle in the future. The chance to do a quick furniture build, a computer cabinet, came shortly after moving into our second house. Time was short, my son Ben was a newborn, and the tools I had on hand were limited. I knew exactly the type of cabinet I wanted to build, and I ran out to Home Depot one Saturday morning and purchased 2' x 4' pine boards. Armed with a skill saw, router, and drill, I went to work and completed the cabinet in under an hour. The cabinet fit the space in my office and served its purpose for the time we spent in that house. Being in IT, I built my computers and was constantly upgrading the system or needing access to the connections on the back of the computer. To simplify access, I designed the right side of the cabinet as removable to provide easy access to the connection ports or to remove the whole computer case. Now it serves as a computer stand for a set up I use primarily for listening to music. Computer Cabinet 2001 -- Now a Computer Audio Station 2018 Building that computer cabinet reignited my drive to get back into woodworking, but it would be several more years before I was able to start. Home renovations took precedence - we moved into our third house (Richmond Hill) and then a fourth (Newmarket). During that period, I spent a lot of time perusing the Lee Valley website planning for the day I could finally pull the trigger to stock my woodworking shop with tools. It was shortly after moving into our fourth house in 2012 that I could dedicate a room for a workshop, had a small amount of free time, and was in a financial position to start buying tools. However, the main incentive to get back into woodworking was building a hall table for my wife's birthday present. It's now early spring 2023, and I'm regularly in the workshop. There has been a steady progression of projects, workshop improvements, jig-making, and tool purchases since 2012 that have led me to begin writing this journal. I find myself wanting to spend more and more time woodworking for many reasons. I look forward to heading down into the workshop in the evenings after work. Woodworking provides a great mental break to clear my mind of the constant problem resolution and stress that comes with my career as a Cyber Security Specialist. I don't even have to be working on a project. Just going down into the shop to clean up, sweep the floor or sharpen a chisel or plane blade helps to ease my mind. An added benefit of just doing chores is that when I dive into a project, the shop and tools are ready to start working. My mind immediately switches gears after stepping into the shop and taking in the fragrance of the wood. Besides stress, the other detriment to my health after spending a quarter of a century in Cyber Security is that I have developed tendonitis. The occasional flare-ups cause my hands to swell up and become extremely painful, stiff, useless clumps at the end of my arms. Using my hands for woodworking provides a great form of physical therapy that counters the impact of typing on a keyboard and using a mouse all day for work. I thoroughly enjoy the time I spend woodworking and have a long list of projects lined up for the future. I probably won't get through all of the projects given I'm now in my mid fifties with retirement still a few years away. One reason for writing this journal is to keep track of the lessons I learn, to capture the knowledge I gain with each project, and who knows, maybe it will become a helpful reference for someone once completed. It is abundantly clear to me through my research and efforts so far that woodworking is a hobby requiring continuous practice and a lifetime to achieve a high level of mastery. My intention for writing this journal is to document the thought processes and techniques used to build furniture I've designed to outlast me and to pass down from one generation to the next. I have lofty ambitions of making furniture that encompasses the lessons and techniques learned by past master furniture makers with timeless appeal and the construction to survive the rigors of everyday use. And who know, the details referenced in this journal may allow someone many decades or hundreds of years from now to perform the inevitable repairs needed to keep the furniture functional or maintain its appearance. I expect this journal will undoubtedly provide value for me, at least as a record of what I've accomplished and who knows maybe as a guide for others as well. It's all about the journey ahead.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Woodworking/ww_intro/#introduction","text":"My introduction to woodworking began back in 1979 in grade seven.
