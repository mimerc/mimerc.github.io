<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>My introduction to woodworking began back in 1979 in grade seven. Once a week, we were bused to a local school for woodworking, home economics, or art.</p>
<p>My first project was a reasonably simple sculpture that didn't require
any exceptional skills. Starting with dimensioned lumber, I used a hand
saw to cut the two pieces I needed to size, the main sculpture and a
base. The two parts were shaped with a bandsaw, and then I used a rasp
and sandpaper to refine the cut edges. A hole was drilled into each
piece, then a short dowel was used to connect them. A quick stain and
I'd completed my first woodworking project.</p>
<p><img alt="Concorde 1979" src="../img/01-Concorde.jpg" title="Concorde 1979" /></p>
<p>The inspiration for my sculpture came from the Concorde, which at the
time was a relatively new French-British turbojet-powered supersonic
airliner, capable of a maximum speed of over twice the speed of sound.</p>
<p>The following year I stepped it up a notch, making a pair of bookends
that combined my woodworking and art projects. I added basic joinery to
my repertoire using butt joints to assemble the bookends. In art class,
I drew a running elk and pressed the image onto thin copper plates,
which I stained and attached to the bookends with brass brads. These
bookends have adorned my bookshelves everywhere I've lived, except
Japan, since 1980.</p>
<p><img alt="Bookends 1980" src="../img/02-BookEnds.jpeg" title="Bookends 1980" /></p>
<p>I continued woodworking throughout high school. Taking woodworking classes happened somewhat through fate. Every year I tried to take Auto Shop or Electricity;
however, I was an Advanced student, so the General level students got
priority for shop classes. Inevitably, during the first week of classes,
I would be kicked out so General level students could take my spot,
leaving woodworking as my only option, which I guess was less popular
than the other shop classes.</p>
<p>I ended up getting six high school credits for woodworking, which
developed the foundation of my skills and started a lifelong passion for
a hobby I hope to enjoy in retirement as a more full-time endeavor
between rounds of golf.</p>
<p>Grade nine brought an introduction to hand tools where we took raw
lumber and had to dimension and finish some of the pieces by hand. For
most of the other work, we were allowed to use the shop machinery.
Oddly, for this project and the cabinet I built in grade eleven, I used
willow. I liked the colour and grain, but most of all I chose it because
it was the cheapest wood available for purchase in our woodworking
class. In all my trips to lumber yards since I've never encountered
willow as an option to purchase, nor have I come across an article in a
woodworking magazine or book that mentions willow as a wood choice for
building furniture. Maybe willow's availability was due to being in the
Niagara Region, which had a lot of willows lining the shores of the
rivers in the area.</p>
<p><img alt="End Table 1981" src="../img/03-EndTable.jpeg" title="End Table 1981" /></p>
<p>In the grade ten woodworking class, we built a toolbox, which introduced
hinged joints and was my first project using plywood. It sat empty for
twenty-five years until we moved into our first house and I started
buying tools for home renovations.</p>
<p><img alt="Tool Box 1982" src="../img/05-Toolbox.jpeg" title="Tool Box 1982" /></p>
<p>Grade eleven involved a much larger project. I built a cabinet from
plans I found in a magazine. I was quite satisfied with the build;
however, I was in a rush at the end of the project and selected a poor
finish. I've always intended to strip and redo the cabinet finish
but never got around to it.</p>
<p><img alt="Cabinet 1984" src="../img/06-HallCabinet.jpeg" title="Cabinet 1984" /></p>
<p>For the top, I selected the best figured wood. However, once finished
and ready for assembly, I agonized over which side to use. The original
pristine side turned out exactly as I wanted, and the opposite side
intended to face inward was flawed with rot hollows. In the end, I chose
the flawed side because I thought it added character to the piece.
Overall the rot details enhanced the intended rustic appearance of the
cabinet and added an immediate sense of age. Going with the alternate
side was a decision I've never regretted and continue to make similar
choices on projects in the constant battle between my perfectionist
nature and artistic instinct.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/07-HallCabinetTop.jpeg" title="Cabinet Top &amp; The Beauty of Natural Flaws" /></p>
<p>The grade twelve woodworking class project was a step stool. The challenge was working out joinery that involved joints intersecting at compound
angles. The stool still resides in my shop and is as structurally stable
as the day I built it, although now it has a more distressed look from
use. High school woodworking classes provided the foundation for my
furniture making and construction knowledge, skills that have served me
well throughout my life.</p>
<p><img alt="Step Stool 1985" src="../img/04-StepStool.jpeg" title="Step Stool 1985" /></p>
<p>On the commute into work this morning, I heard on the radio that most
millennials have never used basic tools such as a screwdriver or hammer
and rely on their fathers for assistance. Trades and hand tool skills
appear to be in decline, but I've moved in the opposite direction,
preferring to do renovations and build furniture myself. I rarely see a
piece of store-bought furniture that I'd purchase by choice and prefer
to find a quality antique or make it myself.</p>
<p>The savings gained doing the renovations myself leaves extra budget for
high-end finishing and more flexibility for customization. Also, I
struggle with paying someone for subpar work and only bring in help if a
job requires specialized skills or equipment, or to save time.</p>
<p>Home renovations began with our first house, purchased in 1997 in Acton,
ON. At first, I think my wife was skeptical of my capabilities and
some of the projects I pursued, but over time and after seeing the
results, she came to trust that I would get the job done. The only
concession was that it often took a long time, and as a result, our
houses were always in some form of half-completed renovation and rarely
in a state of completion to satisfy her requirements to host parties.</p>
<p>Following high school, my woodworking took an extended hiatus
(1987-2001). I spent several years in university and college, lived in
Japan for a year, began my career, got married, and started a family.
During that period, I kept an eye out for furniture I liked and kept a
mental list of furniture projects I wanted to tackle in the future.</p>
<p>The chance to do a quick furniture build, a computer cabinet, came
shortly after moving into our second house. Time was short, my son Ben
was a newborn, and the tools I had on hand were limited. I knew exactly
the type of cabinet I wanted to build, and I ran out to Home Depot one
Saturday morning and purchased 2' x 4' pine boards. Armed with a skill
saw, router, and drill, I went to work and completed the cabinet in
under an hour.</p>
<p>The cabinet fit the space in my office and served its purpose for the
time we spent in that house. Being in IT, I built my computers and was
constantly upgrading the system or needing access to the connections on
the back of the computer. To simplify access, I designed the right side
of the cabinet as removable to provide easy access to the connection
ports or to remove the whole computer case. Now it serves as a computer
stand for a set up I use primarily for listening to music.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/08-ComputerCabinet.jpeg" title="Computer Cabinet 2001 - Now a Computer Audio Station 2018" /></p>
<p>Building that computer cabinet reignited my drive to get back into
woodworking, but it would be several more years before I was able to
start. Home renovations took precedence - we moved into our third house
(Richmond Hill) and then a fourth (Newmarket). During that period, I
spent a lot of time perusing the Lee Valley website planning for the day
I could finally pull the trigger to stock my woodworking shop with
tools. It was shortly after moving into our fourth house in 2012 that I
could dedicate a room for a workshop, had a small amount of free time,
and was in a financial position to start buying tools. However, the main
incentive to get back into woodworking was building a hall table for my
wife's birthday present.</p>
<p>It's now early spring 2023, and I'm
regularly in the workshop. There has been a steady progression of
projects, workshop improvements, jig-making, and tool purchases since
2012 that have led me to begin writing this journal.</p>
<p>I find myself wanting to spend more and more time woodworking for many
reasons. I look forward to heading down into the workshop in the
evenings after work. Woodworking provides a great mental break to clear
my mind of the constant problem resolution and stress that comes with my
career as a Cyber Security Specialist. I don't even have to be working
on a project. Just going down into the shop to clean up, sweep the floor
or sharpen a chisel or plane blade helps to ease my mind. An added
benefit of just doing chores is that when I dive into a project, the
shop and tools are ready to start working. My mind immediately switches
gears after stepping into the shop and taking in the fragrance of the
wood.</p>
<p>Besides stress, the other detriment to my health after spending a
quarter of a century in Cyber Security is that I have developed
tendonitis. The occasional flare-ups cause my hands to swell up and
become extremely painful, stiff, useless clumps at the end of my arms.
Using my hands for woodworking provides a great form of physical therapy
that counters the impact of typing on a keyboard and using a mouse all
day for work.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the time I spend woodworking and have a long list of
projects lined up for the future. I probably won't get through all of
the projects given I'm now in my mid fifties with retirement still
a few years away. One reason for writing this journal is to keep
track of the lessons I learn, to capture the knowledge I gain with each
project, and who knows, maybe it will become a helpful reference for
someone once completed. It is abundantly clear to me through my research
and efforts so far that woodworking is a hobby requiring continuous
practice and a lifetime to achieve a high level of mastery.</p>
<p>My intention for writing this journal is to
document the thought processes and techniques used to build furniture
I've designed to outlast me and to pass down from one generation to the
next. I have lofty ambitions of making furniture that encompasses the
lessons and techniques learned by past master furniture makers
with timeless appeal and the construction to survive the rigors of
everyday use. And who know, the details referenced in
this journal may allow someone many decades or hundreds of years from
now to perform the inevitable repairs needed to keep the
furniture functional or maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>I expect this journal will undoubtedly provide value for me, at least as
a record of what I've accomplished and who knows maybe as a guide for
others as well. It's all about the journey ahead.</p></div>
