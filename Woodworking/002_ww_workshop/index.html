<h1 id="the-workshop">The Workshop</h1>
<p>For more than a decade before setting up my first dedicated woodworking
shop, I had been reading articles in woodworking magazines that provided
suggestions for the essential tools needed and ways to arrange the
workspace. There was some consistency in what I read, but like
everything else, everyone has their own opinion. What works for them
may not work for you. As I stated in the introduction, woodworking is a
life-long journey, and as your work progresses and what you need to do
it continually changes. Developing new woodworking skills
and the types of projects you choose to build dictates the best
layout for your shop and the tools you require to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>Use what follows as a guide, as many factors will influence the tools
you purchase and the organization of your shop. One of the first
considerations is the space size you have to set up shop. My
current workshop is 11'6" x 21'6". With the table saw set up midway
along the longer wall, there is just enough room to rip a full sheet of
4' x 8' plywood lengthwise. If the room were any shorter or narrower, I
I could not cut sheet goods. If your room is smaller than mine
and you intend to do work that requires cutting sheet goods or ripping
long pieces of lumber (my lumber supplier sells primarily 14' boards)
you need to consider having an alternative place to do that type of
work, like a garage or outside space using a portable table saw or skill
saw. Unless you intend to do small projects only and not use sheet
goods, I'd suggest the minimum space needed to provide a functional
woodworking shop is 12' x 22'. However, the larger, the better. A
smaller shop doesn't leave much room for moving boards around or
assembling large projects, but it's just enough to get by. I hope that
my next house has a larger workspace</p>
<p><img alt="First Workshop 2019 Iteration" src="../img/image10.jpeg" title="First Workshop 2019 Iteration" /></p>
<p><img alt="The Lennard Factory Cabinet" src="../img/image11.jpeg" title="The Lennard Factory Cabinet" /></p>
<p>You can certainly get away with a smaller workspace if you intend to
build only smaller projects like boxes or small cabinets, but another
thing to consider is wood storage. If you buy your wood for projects as
you go or only keep a limited supply on hand, you may be able to get by,
but wood does tend to accumulate. As mentioned, where I purchase lumber
sells only 14' lengths or shorts, and the supply varies from visit
to visit, so I buy a board just because it may not be on hand
when I need it later. Also, the cutoffs and scrap pieces
accumulate and may prove useful for other projects.</p>
<p>I find it very convenient to have the wood in the workshop. Wood must be stored properly to avoid severe warping, twisting or cupping. Even
kiln-dried wood, if stored improperly, may warp and twist to where it is
no longer usable, causing excess waste. As wood is expensive, this is
something to avoid. Proper storage is a factor in determining how much
space you'll need, especially with sheet goods that take up a lot of
space and require additional room to move around in the shop.</p>
<p><img alt="Workshop Wood Storage" src="../img/image12.jpeg" title="Workshop Wood Storage" /></p>
<p>Consider storing wood in the shop to acclimate at the same
relative humidity as the build time. Otherwise, you may end up with
unexpected results or unusable lumber. Before using newly purchased
wood, I keep it in the shop for a few weeks to avoid issues.
Straight out of the kiln wood has about a 6% moisture content and then
depending on how long it is stored, where it is stored (inside or
outside), the climate where you live, the time of year, the moisture
content will be somewhat higher. A wood supply in the shop
ensures stability during the construction process.</p>
<p>If workshop wood storage is not an option, you'll want it close. My
current workshop is in the basement, so bringing pieces in from
the garage or outside is a pain. Purchased lumber goes straight into
the shop, and sheet goods in a separate room. At times,
especially at the start of a new project, the wood can pile up and get
in the way, but it's generally just temporary, and I've learned to adapt
while I contemplate the day I'm working in a bigger workshop.</p>
<h2 id="the-workbench">The Workbench</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the workbench is the most critical component of the
workshop. A workbench should provide a stable workspace that efficiently
holds a wide variety of workpieces. It sounds like a simple task, but in
reality, it's far more of a challenge than you would think. My first
workbench was purchased in 2012 on sale at Canadian Tire for \$100. For
the price, it seemed like a good buy as I couldn't build a workbench for
that price and I thought it would fit my needs until I found or made
something better. Also, to this point, I hadn't done enough woodworking
to know what I'd need or how I'd be using the workbench. I'm not going
to go into any great detail on workbench selection, for that topic I recommend the book <em>Workbenches</em> by Christopher
Schwarz.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/image13.jpeg" title="Canadian Tire Workbench" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Canadian Tire workbench was too small and light to be
of much use. While hand planing boards, the entire workbench would move
across the floor or kick up once the plane took purchase into the wood.
It was of some use for specific light-duty tasks, but mostly it became a
place to put my tools as I worked. Instead, I used the table saw outfeed
table I built for most of my woodworking.</p>
<p>In late 2017 after reading <em>Workbenches</em>, I decided to build my
variation of the Roubo Workbench to fit my workshop and as a test run
before building the full workbench in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="Workbench 2018" src="../img/image14.jpeg" title="Workbench 2018" /> </p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed building this workbench. Many workbench designs suggest using standard stud grade lumber to save money, but I chose molding grade Pine and Ash for the top edges and the 9" Eclipse vise.</p>
<p>I decided not to install a tail vise thinking that I'd retrofit one if I
needed to and bought a Veritas Wonder Dog to determine if it was a
sufficient alternative. However, to date, I haven't made much use of the
Wonder Dog or found much need for a tail vise.</p>
<p>I added a sliding deadman for working with long boards and purchased
holdfasts for clamping work to the bench. Both devices have been used
for woodworking for hundreds of years, and they are the most efficient,
simplest, and cheapest methods of holding boards that I have found to
date. In the picture of the workbench, you'll see a Veritas Planing Stop on the
benchtop in front of the vise, which is a simple and effective way to
hold boards while dimensioning with a hand plane.</p>
<p>Unlike the Canadian Tire workbench, this workbench is in constant use
and I continue to adapt it as my woodworking skills improve. There are
some pretty decent store-bought workbench options, but they are costly
and besides the potential savings, the experience of building your
workbench is worth the effort. I'll base my next workbench on the Le
Roubo workbench described in the book <em>Workbenches</em> by Christopher
Schwarz outfitted with a Benchcrafted leg vise. To purchase the
 Benchcrafted Benchmaker's Package in 2025 would cost $1550 USD.
Hopefully, my next workbench, buying only the leg vise, will make it
into this journal a few years from now. Until then, I have the plate
depicting Andre Roubo's workbench from his 18th-century woodworking book
<em>L'art du Menuisier</em> hanging on the wall of my office as inspiration.</p>
